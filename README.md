# BootCamp-Week-1
Some class activities and homework

1) Arrange the css so that everything flows naturally with the page:
      -- "search engine optimization" "online reputation management" and  "social media marketing" should be listed under the class content

2) added comments for css and html

2) Reduce the amount of classes:
      -- refacted .benefit subgroup to benefit-groups, h3 and img to have the same margins and color for all benefit-groups items
      -- refacted .content subgroup to content-groups, h2 and img to have the same margins and color for all content-group items
